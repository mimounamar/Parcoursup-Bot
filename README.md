# Parcoursup Bot

## What is it?

This projet is simply a bot that reports my transcripts from PRONOTE to Parcoursup. 

As those two apps do not provide any API, I had to use Selenium to achieve that.

## How does it work?
It is actually really simple. In the command line, you are asked how you want to recover your marks and appreciations (from a PDF file downloaded from PRONOTE or via the web interface). After you provide the necessary credentials the bot does the work for you! Kindly note that is made to work with my school's settings of PRONOTE. However, you are free to use it and edit it!
